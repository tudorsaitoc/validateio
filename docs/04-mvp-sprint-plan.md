## Development Workflow

### Daily Routine
```
9:00 AM - Daily standup (self-check)
9:15 AM - Code until 12:00 PM
12:00 PM - Lunch break
1:00 PM - Code until 5:00 PM
5:00 PM - Update progress, plan next day
```

### Code Review Process
- Self-review before committing
- Run tests and linting
- Update documentation
- Deploy to staging

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for agents
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Manual testing for UI/UX

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **LLM API failures**: Implement retry logic and fallbacks
- **Slow response times**: Add caching and optimize prompts
- **High costs**: Monitor usage and set limits

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP features only
- **Integration issues**: Test early and often
- **Learning curve**: Allocate time for research

## Success Metrics

### Per Sprint
- Sprint 1: 100% of auth flows working
- Sprint 2: <30s average analysis time
- Sprint 3: <5min page generation time
- Sprint 4: <1s event tracking latency
- Sprint 5: 5+ ad variations generated

### Overall MVP
- Full validation cycle <10 minutes
- All agents functioning at 85%+ success rate
- Cost per validation <$2
- System uptime >95%
